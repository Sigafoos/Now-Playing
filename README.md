Possibly this is something only I'll use, but:

- There is a meta box on the "edit post" page that allows you to add an artist, song title and url

- If you at least give a url it will embed the video at the top of a post, which will drop down onclick

- IMPORTANT: It requires Font Awesome, http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/ for the music and chevron icons

## Supported services
* Youtube
* Vimeo

## To do
* Switch my current display:none to use Bootstrap's accordion
* Remove Font-Awesome and use Glyphicon
* Add Soundcloud
* Add Bandcamp
